# ECC Operations
This repository contains the ECC Operations contract by BlockInfinity.

## Features
- Computation of the inverse
- Doubling of curve points
- Addition of curve points
- Scalar multiplication of curve points

## Limitations
- Due to gas costs exceeding the block gas limit, computing a scalar multiplication involving a large scalar is currently not feasible on the Ethereum mainnet.
